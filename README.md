# Network-Graphs-and-Network-Analysis

This is a home work of Network Analysis from online course â€œMITx 6.419: Data Analysis: Statistical Modeling and Computation in Applications".

The last part of this assignment is an open-ended project. We had to choose a sociologically interesting question about either the CAVIAR network or the facebook or twitter network from the recitation notebook section (for the social network data, go to https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html and https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Twitter.html, or any other publicly available network data set, e.g. those at https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html.


In this question I will focus on using network graphs to show how friends on Facebook
are connected. We hope to verify the strength of weak ties. (The weak ties states that
We can have thousands of connections with others but only a few of them are close
friends. Instead of focusing on building stronger ties, we should build hundreds or
thousands of weak ones.)
